The SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) package plays a pivotal role in our data transformation and migration project. This package orchestrates the seamless transition from old_dealer_id to new_dealer_id across various data tables.

Utilizing backend SSIS processes, the package systematically updates dealer_id references while intelligently preserving the historical context through retention of old_dealer_id. Additionally, rows with updated dealer_ids are automatically relocated to a dedicated parking table.

This package serves as the backbone of our data cleaning initiative, ensuring data accuracy and maintaining historical integrity. It empowers the client to harness accurate insights and make informed decisions.
